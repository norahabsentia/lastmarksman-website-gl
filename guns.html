                    The Zental is a bullpop type assault rifle, as a lot of improvement over its predecessors like the recriprocation problem of the charging handle was removed, abilty to add a scope. The Zental is much more compact and high performance when compared to other bulpops, making it a favourite for combat missions.  The Zental found its first use by the UN peace forces in the war on Tzura river against koila koko terrorists.  If ever you are loosing an argument about why bullpop rifles are best, use Zental as a trump card, and rest your case.

Although technically its an assault rifle , it also became popular amongst DM, because of its moderately long range.

                    The 2.7 version was made with only one purpose in mind , increase the damage, and that, it did, at the cost of a low increse in weight, and almost no change in the recoil. BoltGun 2.7 soon replaced 1.2 in terms of market share despite of being expensive and soon became everyones favourite.

                    The Hyperoid belongs to CM series which is indigenously manufactured antimaterial sniper rifle, designed to hit through military equipment. Its ultrahigh accuracy and high damage makes it a deadly rifle but its heavy weight restricts it use for specific combat use only.   CSF used Hyperoid against both the militant factions responsible for civil war in Taiwan. Its ability to go through walls chased away militias and forced both the forces to surrender.
